# Overview
The "Pizza" project is designed to revolutionize the pizza delivery system by implementing a sophisticated algorithm to calculate the delivery time and distance for each order. This project leverages advanced programming techniques to optimize delivery routes, ensuring customers receive their orders promptly and efficiently.
# Key Features
Time Calculation:
The system estimates the time required to deliver a pizza based on various factors, including the distance to the delivery address, traffic conditions, and historical delivery data.
The algorithm considers real-time traffic updates to provide accurate delivery time estimates.
Distance Calculation:
The system uses geolocation services to determine the precise distance between the pizza store and the delivery address.
It accounts for different routes and selects the most efficient path to minimize travel distance.
Optimization Algorithm:
The core of the project is an optimization algorithm that balances delivery time and distance.
Techniques such as Dijkstra's algorithm, A* search, or even machine learning models could be employed to find the optimal route.
